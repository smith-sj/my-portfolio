        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
        I have a <b>Diploma of Information Technology</b> from Coder Academy, Melbourne (Academy of Information Technology).
        Below is my tech-stack; each section expands with further insight into my knowledge of the technology.
        </p>

                    <h3>HTML & CSS<div class="underline"></div></h3>
                </summary>
                <p>Focusing on mobile-first responsive layouts, accessible design and semantic elements, I've learned to craft flexible user-friendly websites. I believe CSS is more powerful than it's often given credit for, and I love exploring advanced CSS solutions before reaching for other technologies. I also have experience with CSS libraries like Bootstrap. <i>(P.s. this site is 100% custom CSS and scores 100% on Lighthouse for Performance, Accessibility and Best Practices!)</i></p>

                    <h3>Ruby & Ruby on Rails<div class="underline"></div></h3>
                </summary>
                <p>In Ruby I explored the foundational concepts of programming, as well as principles such as OOP, DRY and TDD. Rails was my first exposure to a web framework, as well as the MVC architecture. Through Rails I also learned about relational database management, HTTP requests, CRUD operations, SQL queries and user authentication.</p>

                    <h3>JavaScript<div class="underline"></div></h3>
                </summary>
                <p>Before diving into JS frameworks, I learned vanilla JavaScript, as well as the fundamentals of DOM manipulation and The Event Loop. Through JavaScript I also explored asynchronous programming and browser / third-party APIs.</p>

                    <h3>MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node)<div class="underline"></div></h3>
                </summary>
                <p>Through MongoDB I learned about non-relational databases and how to manage large diverse datasets. I discovered NodeJS and the exciting possibilities that come from running JS locally, and practiced building ExpressJS web applications and APIs. I started learning React by building a simple SPA for a hackathon and was immediately <i>hook</i>ed. I've since built several larger React applications and have explored component lifecycles, state management and reducers, React routing, custom hooks and more. </p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>As a recording and performing musician for more than a decade, I'm no stranger to creative collaboration. I understand the importance of keeping an open mind within a team environment, and I'm confident in contributing to conversations.</p>
            <p>I was drawn to programming through a love of solving problems and a hankering for learning. During my educational journey in web development, I have grown passionate about building accessible, user-friendly applications with creative solutions to real problems.</p>
            <p>I'm currently seeking opportunities and contacts in the industry. Whether you're a hiring manager looking for a junior dev, or a junior dev looking for a comrade, please don't hesitate to <a href="./contact">say hello!</a></p>
