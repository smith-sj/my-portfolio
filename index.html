                <p>Focusing on mobile-first responsive layouts, accessible design and semantic elements, I've learned to craft flexible user-friendly websites. I'm passionate about building with custom CSS, and have experience with various CSS libraries as well.</p>

                <p>In Ruby I explored the foundational concepts of programming, as well as principles such as OOP, DRY and TDD. Rails was my first exposure to a web framework, as well as the MVC architecture. Through Rails I also learned about relational database management, CRUD operations, SQL queries and user authentication.</p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm a junior web dev, musician and multi-hobbyist. I've been performing and writing music for most of my life, but I've also been a barista, an e-commerce manager and most recently a carpenter.</p>
            <p>Having worked in a diverse range of industries, with an eclectic mix of people, I enjoy applying an open-mind and intentional approach to each project. I was drawn to programming through my love of solving complex problems, and during the bootcamp, I became passionate about building accessible and user-friendly applications.</p>
            <p>I'm currently seeking opportunities and contacts in the industry. Whether you're a hiring manager looking for a junior dev, or a junior dev looking for a comrade, please don't hesitate to <a href="./contact">say hello!</a></p>
